# Description
There are two programs that can be ran directly:
* `Network_Intrusion_Prediction_Models.py` - this program serves as the main driver for all of the algorithms
implemented. Running this produces an interactive terminal where you choose which dataset and which algorithm you want to run.
* `NaiveBayes_Automation.py` - this program serves as an example of how to automate each of the algorithms proveided.
This program runs the Naive Bayes algorithm with the sklearn back-end 10 times with default parameters and outputs the 
results to a log file

The other python files included are templates for the implementation of the algorithms, which can be tweaked with 
different parameters.
